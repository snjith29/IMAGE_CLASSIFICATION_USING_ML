# IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION_USING_ML
Plant Disease is necessary for every farmer so we are created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using convolutional Neural Network for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. For Training we are using Plant village dataset. Dataset Link is in My Blog Section. Run Project in your Machine
You must have Python3.8 installed in your machine.
Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment Link
Install all the dependencies using below command pip install -r requirements.txt
Go to the Flask Deployed App folder.
Download the pre-trained model file plant_disease_model_1.pt from here
Add the downloaded file in Flask Deployed App folder.
Run the Flask app using below command python3 app.py
You can also use downloaded file in Model Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.
